    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>Hello all, My name is Ryan Clark Matthews. I am a soon to be husband this September 25th to my beautiful Fiancee' Amanda, and am a dad to a gorgeous 1 year old girl named Haven. I remotely operate and own a "The UPS Store" franchise, go to school full time, and love being outdoors. Below I have posted a picture of the Manitou Incline in Colorado Springs, Co. I climbed this for my birthday a few years back, it was AWSOME. Then of course I had to include our beloved Pensacola Beach because i'v been in love with the beach since I was a kid!</p><br>
