    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>To say that I have grown as a Designer, and a person In general in the last week, is an understatement. With the load i'm pulling, I have learned SO many awsome things, including coding HTML. I am a graphic Design major here at UWF, and my love for art, design, & music, I got from my dad.The fact that our remembrance and associations completely go away without the branding of products or the creations of a logo for a company or item, is so extremely powerful, and is why I am here. I want to provide designs for people that they can be proud of, and to make a positive impact on our society. Below I included a piece called "The American Dream" by Salvador Dali, because he was the first artist that literally WOW'd me when I began learning artists. I also included a little sketch I imported in of a Viking and edited in photoshop a couple years ago. This was my very first project of any kind with design!</p><br>
