            <p1 style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> This is going to be a little weird. We were tasked to create net.art, on the web, creating a series of 5-8 webpages that are linked together. We started with randomizing a group of approximately 100 words, and creating a sort of theme. What I came up with was, weird mammals looking at small symbols. No matter how random, I went with it. It only made sense. I used divs and positioning techniques to place the photoshopped images into place, matching my previous compositions that were presented in my initial process book. Although this is sort of random, I feel like I truly captured the randomness of the word selection. Hitting the mark and actually doign what I wanted to do with this, is another story. I struggled with this project, but I did eventually understand the Divs better and better, the more I struggled. <br>
                <br>
                I think what I learned from this project is the fact that no matter how on point you may seem about how ready you are to take new tasks on, everyone learns differently, and you never know when you will be presented with something that gives you more trouble than others. No matter how simple this was, creating it was an accomplishment in my book, simply becaues I didn't give up on the task. All the pages are linked together in a sort of hidden way, that will let the viewer jump back and forth sparatically from one page to another. It is all linked together by this project launch page, which is embedded into my main Index page.
